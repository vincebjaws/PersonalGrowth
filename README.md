You can do it, for myself, for Janelle, for my future.

This is a personal dir for me to work on things I know and start from the ground up.

Step one: Set up goals.

Goals:
  - Get reacquainted with what you know the best.
    * Python
    * C++
    * SQL
  - Practice everyday, be humble, be strict.
  - Practice good programmer habits.
  - Don't let anxiety, and depression dibilitate you. Let it drive you.
  - Learn to fail again.

Step two: Make a plan.
  - Starting April 11th, 2022 I will practice coding everyday I can.
  - Spend two weeks on one topic intensively, do not get distracted.
